# ProtRAP
Deep learning based protein relative accessibility predictor to predict the relative lipid accessibility and relative solvent accessibility of residues from a given protein sequence
## Introduction
Solvent accessibility has been extensively used to characterize and predict the chemical properties of the surface residues of soluble proteins. However, there is not yet a widely accepted quantity of the same dimension for the study of lipid-accessible residues of membrane proteins. Here we propose that lipid accessibility, defined in a similar way to solvent accessibility, can be used to characterize the lipid accessible residues of membrane proteins.

In models.py, we provide the definition and implementation of the final model (Transformer light).

driver.py is a simple demonstration of how to process input data and process models

prot.feat, prot.fasta are example files
### Quick start
We provide a prediction server to meet researchers' small batch sample prediction needs.
  
  http://www.songlab.cn/ProtRAP/Introduction/
### Requirements
* PyTorch
* NumPy
### Feature generation
Our model requires One-hot encoded sequence information (20 bits), PSSM (20 bits) and predicted SS3 (3 bits) as input features.

The order of One-hot encoding is: ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY,
we provide the seq2arr function in the driver.py file

PSSM and predicted SS3 were generated by [RaptorX-Property](https://github.com/realbigws/RaptorX_Property_Fast) aligning against database [uniclust30_2017_10](http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/uniclust/2017_10/). The file suffix is .feat, and we provide the load_feat function in the driver.py file
### Usage
First download the weights file we provided in Releases. Then use `torch.load(absolute path)` to load the model.

Our driver.py provides easier usage. It can automatically process data, download models:
```bash
python driver.py --data prot 
```

It can also download ten models trained by the ten-fold cross validation, and taking the average predicted value to achieve a more stable result.
```bash
python driver.py --data prot --ten_average True 
```
